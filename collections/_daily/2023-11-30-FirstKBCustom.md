    My first ever keyboard modding! I purchaseed Azoth in July. I'm actually pretty satisfying with the original setup but I thinking the sound and the feeling from switch could be better.<br>
    So I change the switches, stabilizers, keycaps and dampening foams. <span style="color: var(--neon-pink)"> Including following parts </span> : <br> 
    <span style="color: var(--neon-yellow);">TTC Tiger Switch RGB Version<br>

    The soundpack does make a difference. But I think you don't have to buy the full pack, especially the plate. 
    The full pack comes with an FR4 plate. It's similar to the original one but lighter, and I don't like that featherweight feeling.
    With the original plate, which has a heavier weight, it gives me more stability.<br>

    To achieve a faster response and trigger time, I use TTC Tiger switches. And it's REALLY fascinating to me. 
    The spring is longer than that of the NX RED, allowing for a faster response with a shorter travel distance. 
    When you push the keys, they come right back to your finger—I love that. Perfect for my use, coding and gaming. Next, I guess I'll try to lube the switches and stabilizers on my own.<br>
