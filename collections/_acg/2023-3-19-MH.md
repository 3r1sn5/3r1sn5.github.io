    Monster Hunter is one of my all-time favorite game series. I remember when I first played it on the PlayStation 2, and then I continued playing on the PSP until Capcom decide to release new MH games(MH4~MHXX) on Nintendo consoles. I took a break from playing MH for a while since I'm a die-hard PlayStation fan.
    Well, I guess I'm not that die-hard. The only reason why I stick to PlayStation is that I couldn't afford a Nintendo console back then, lol. I do really like Sony and PlayStation products, but I also enjoy playing various games. Until 2018, CAPCOM finally comes back with MHW, I bought PS4 Pro MHW special edition immediately. Then Nintendo is affordable for me in 2021, so I bought Switch MHR special edition.<br>
    Anyway, back to the games. As a kid who didn't know any Japanese and spent thousands of hours on MH, I had to guess and try every button in the game, but I still had a lot of fun playing it. I think that's the power and charm of the game, and CAPCOM did a terrific job on it. I just felt what a game should be when I grabbed my old buddy PSP out a while ago. Despite the graphics not being good and the animation not being fancy, but I can still have much fun on it.
