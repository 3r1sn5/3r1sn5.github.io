         Specs : <br>
         <span style="color: var(--neon-yellow);">Motherboard </span>: MSI MEG Z790 GODLIKE. It's overkill, of course. The reason I chose this motherboard is because I wanna have some fun with it. :P<br>
         <span style="color: var(--neon-yellow);">CPU</span> : Intel Core i9-13900KF. I was considering AMD Ryzen/Threadripper, but after evaluating the applications I use, I eventually chose Intel<br>
         <span style="color: var(--neon-yellow);">GPU</span> : MSI 4090 Gaming Trio. For training some Models. <br>
         <span style="color: var(--neon-yellow);">RAM</span> : G.Skill Trident Z5 32GB\(\times\)2. For heavy load.<br>
         <span style="color: var(--neon-yellow);">PSU</span> : MSI MEG Ai1300P. For future upgrades and 4090.<br>
         <span style="color: var(--neon-yellow);">SSD</span> : Solidigm P44 Pro 1TB\(\times\)2 and 2TB\(\times\)2. Two 1TB drives, one for Ubuntu and one for Windows, and each OS has a 2TB data drive.<br>
         <span style="color: var(--neon-yellow);">Cooler</span> : MSI MEG Coreliquid S360. An air cooler can't handle a 13900K well, and nowadays, AIO coolers are pretty stable.<br>
         <span style="color: var(--neon-yellow);">Case</span> : MSI MEG Prospect 700R. It has some fancy features, such as the LCD on top of it, and it's officially verified to support for the Z790 Godlike.<br>
         <span style="color: var(--neon-yellow);">Keyboard</span> : ASUS ROG Azoth (ROG NX Red Switches). I did some <a style="color: var(--neon-pink);" href="https://3r1sn5.github.io/daily/FirstKBCustom/"> modifications </a> on it.<br>
         <span style="color: var(--neon-yellow);">Mouse</span> : ASUS ROG Harpe Ace Aim Lab Edition. I used the G502 (both wired and wireless) for years, 
         and it served me well, but now, inexplicably, I find myself wanting something lighter.<br>
         <span style="color: var(--neon-yellow);">Monitor</span> : MSI G274QPF-QD. 2K resolution and 144Hz refresh rate. I would say it's perfect for coding, reading and gaming.<br>
         <span style="color: var(--neon-yellow);">Headset</span> : Audeze Maxwell. I'm using Maxwell as my main headset of my PC, maxwell get a well balance between audiophile and gamer. <br>
