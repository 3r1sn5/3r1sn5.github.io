              A proposition is a declarative sentence that is either <span style="color: var(--neon-pink);">TRUE </span>or <span style="color: var(--neon-pink);  ">FALSE</span>, but not both.<br>
              e.g. "Taipei is capital of Taiwan." is a proposition. "What's your name?" and "x+1=2" aren't proposition since the first is not a declarative, the  second is neither true or false.<br>
              There are 2 types of proposition.<br>
              Atomic proposition<br>
              Compound proposition<br>

              Not \(\neg\): \(\neg\)P. \(\land\) is also called disjunction.<br>
              And \(\land\): P\(\land\)Q, P and Q. \(\land\) is also called conjunction.<br>
              Or \(\lor\): P\(\lor\)Q, P or Q<br>
              Imply \(\implies\): P \(\implies\)Q is called conditional proposition. P is sufficient for Q, Q is necessary for P. It is equal to P only if Q.<br>
              If and only if \(\iff\): P\(\iff\)Q is called bi-conditional proposition, and also denoted as "P iff Q". P, Q is sufficent & necessary for each other.<br>
