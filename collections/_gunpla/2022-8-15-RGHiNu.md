I haven't "FULLY" built GUNPLA for a couple years, this is the first build since then.<br>
Hi-Nu, GUNPLA Of The Year, without doubt, feel like a MG grade but in 1/144 scale.And I like how they make it look slimmer than the original design or MG version(Ver.KA), slimmer but wiry.<br>

My skill is a little bit rusty, as I keep making some silly mistake during every process.<br>
But I guess it will get better, but there are some issues that I would fix in other parts.<br>
    <ul>
        <li>Step between water decal and the parts : Though the flat surface make the step not that obvious, but I think it can be better</li>
        <li>Color division : There are still some room can divide into more colors.And there should be three different purple, but the colors I used are too close so it is not that obvious.However, I think the division of white parts is pretty decent.</li>
        <li>Spray painting is not even : It only happens on one part, but it is sooooo conspicuous.And it was found after I finished the decal and flat coating</li>
    </ul>
